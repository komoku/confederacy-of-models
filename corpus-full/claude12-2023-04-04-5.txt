The primordial beast let out a piercing shriek as it descended from the roiling gray sky, its leathery wings casting a shadow over the granite-paved streets of New Orleans.

Ignatius J. Reilly ambled down the sidewalk, oblivious as ever, focused on the Valencia he clutched and the fantasies playing out in his voracious mind. His substantial bulk shook with each step, the excess flesh spilling out of his hunting cap and sweatshirt like rising bread dough.

When the shadow passed over him, Ignatius glanced up with a start. The pterodactyl unleashed another unearthly screech, indignant at this blob of a man who dared walk under its domain.

Ignatius blinked myopically at the creature and snorted. "What prehistoric nonsense is this? Some misguided fool has clearly released you from your confinement in the geological strata. Begone, you ridiculous beast, or I shall be forced to thrash you soundly with my umbrella!"

Enraged, the pterodactyl swooped down, gnarled claws extended, snapping its beak in fury. But Ignatius swung his umbrella in a wide arc, batting the beast aside. It tumbled and flapped awkwardly, crashing into a lamppost, dazed by the assault.

"Thoughtless demon!" Ignatius cried. He charged at the pterodactyl, surprisingly nimble for his size, and began striking it about the head and neck with his umbrella, each blow punctuated with an insult. "Sugar-frosted fruitcake! Detritus of the Jurassic! Blithering idiot of an avian menace!"

After a thrashing unlike any it had experienced in 65 million years, the pterodactyl fled squealing into the sky, thoroughly chastened by the wrath of Ignatius J. Reilly. Ignatius straightened his hunting cap and sniffed. The Valencia crisis averted once more, he resumed his lumbering perambulations down the streets of New Orleans.
