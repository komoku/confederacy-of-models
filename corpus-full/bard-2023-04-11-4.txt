Ignatius J. Reilly, the great sloth of modern literature, was not a man for violence. He was a man of peace, a man of reason, a man of inaction. But when a pterodactyl attacked him on the streets of New Orleans, Ignatius was forced to defend himself.

The pterodactyl was a fearsome creature, with sharp claws and teeth and a wingspan of twenty feet. Ignatius was no match for it in a fair fight, but he was not about to give up without a struggle.

He drew his sword, a trusty weapon that he had carried with him for many years. The pterodactyl roared and charged at him. Ignatius swung his sword, but the pterodactyl was too quick. It dodged the blow and raked its claws across Ignatius's chest.

Ignatius cried out in pain, but he did not give up. He charged at the pterodactyl again, this time swinging his sword with all his might. The sword struck the pterodactyl's wing, and the creature cried out in agony.

The pterodactyl fell to the ground, wounded and defeated. Ignatius stood over it, his sword raised in triumph. He had won the battle, but he knew that this was only the beginning. There would be other battles, other challenges. But Ignatius was ready. He was Ignatius J. Reilly, and he would not be defeated.

Ignatius turned and walked away, leaving the pterodactyl to its fate. He knew that he would never forget this day, the day he faced down a pterodactyl and won. It was a day that would change his life forever.

As he walked, Ignatius thought about what had happened. He had always been a coward, afraid of everything. But today, he had faced his fears and come out victorious. He had learned that he was stronger than he thought he was.

Ignatius J. Reilly was a changed man. He was no longer a coward. He was a warrior.
