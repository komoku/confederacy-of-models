The prehistoric beast let out a bone-chilling screech as it swooped down from the petrified skies, its leathery wings sending a foul wind to tousle Ignatius's greasy locks.

"Cretinous creature! Retreat at once or suffer the wrath of Ignatius J. Reilly, crusader of rights and avenger of wrongs!" Ignatius hollered up at the pterodactyl, brandishing his Big Chief tablet.

The pterodactyl snapped its beak menacingly and uttered a derisive squawk, as if to mock Ignatius's valve. This impudence would not stand.

Ignatius reared back and hurled his Big Chief tablet at the prehistoric fowl, but the wind sent it awry. The pterodactyl let out a triumphant shriek and commenced a dive-bombing run at Ignatius, talons splayed and beak open in bloodlust.

Ignatius scrambled beneath the beast, his bulk shaking with each footfall. "Help, help! This despicable creature seeks to make a meal of me!" he cried in vain to the deserted, primordial landscape.

With surprising agility, Ignatius grasped a large branch and swung with all his might, clocking the pterodactyl in its scaly breast. The beast tumbled and crashed to the jungle floor, squawking and flapping in a fury.

Ignatius climbed atop the pterodactyl and pinned its gnashing beak shut with his meaty hands. " There shall be no feast today, foul fowl!" he proclaimed. The pterodactyl's beady eyes glared bloody murder at Ignatius in helpless rage.

Ignatius was smug in triumph. The prehistoric beast had met its match in he, Ignatius J. Reilly, erudite crusader and vanquisher of villains from times primeval. The peculiarities of spacetime had allowed Ignatius to prove his valor across the continuum of history itself.
