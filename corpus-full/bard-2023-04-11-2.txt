Ignatius J. Reilly, the great sloth of modern literature, was walking home from Levy Pants one day when he came across a most unusual sight. There, in the middle of the street, was a pterodactyl.

The pterodactyl was large and fearsome, with sharp teeth and claws. Ignatius had never seen anything like it before. He stood there for a moment, frozen in fear.

The pterodactyl roared and lunged at Ignatius. Ignatius screamed and ran for his life. He ran down the street, dodging cars and pedestrians. The pterodactyl was right behind him, gaining ground with every step.

Ignatius could feel the pterodactyl's hot breath on his neck. He knew he couldn't outrun it forever. He had to do something.

Suddenly, Ignatius had an idea. He stopped running and turned to face the pterodactyl. He took a deep breath and shouted, "I am Ignatius J. Reilly! I am the sloth of modern literature! I am the master of this city! You shall not pass!"

The pterodactyl roared in anger. It reared back its head and prepared to strike.

But Ignatius was ready for it. He charged forward, swinging his arms like a madman. He hit the pterodactyl in the face, knocking it off balance. The pterodactyl stumbled back, stunned.

Ignatius took advantage of the pterodactyl's momentary weakness. He charged forward again, this time landing a blow to the pterodactyl's stomach. The pterodactyl roared in pain and doubled over.

Ignatius was on a roll. He landed blow after blow, pummeling the pterodactyl with his fists. The pterodactyl was helpless against Ignatius's fury.

Finally, after what seemed like an eternity, the pterodactyl lay defeated on the ground. Ignatius stood over it, victorious.

The people of the city gathered around to watch. They cheered and applauded for Ignatius. He had saved them from the pterodactyl. He was a hero.

Ignatius smiled. He had finally found his place in the world. He was the sloth of modern literature. He was the master of this city. He was a hero.
