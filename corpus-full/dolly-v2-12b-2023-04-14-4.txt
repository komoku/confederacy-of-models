The sun was setting, the pterodactyl circled high above, silhouetted against the last vestiges of daylight. The ground shook as it swooped down, rumbling beneath the turf. The pterodactyl's wings were powerful, yet it was still forced to fly at a slower pace than it had earlier in the day. As it hovered over the Irish village, Ignatius J. Reilly emerged from his cottage and watched it with fear and wonderment.

The pterodactyl screeched, an unearthly sound that filled the air. Ignatius J. Reilly's jaw dropped in awe. The pterodactyl was clearly agitated, perhaps sensing that it was not the top of the food chain. It swooped down toward the Irishman, who backed away. The beast was fast, swerving in close to Ignatius, barely avoiding contact. It opened its wings, ready to attack.

Ignatius J. Reilly raised his rifle, a wicked look in his eyes. The pterodactyl read his thoughts, and instead of attacking, it swooped down and stole a kiss from the astonished Ignatius J. Reilly. The Irishman fired, but the pterodactyl was too fast. It swerved out of the way and the bullet passed through its wing. The beast roared in agony, and swooped down at Ignatius J. Reilly. The Irishman fired again, but this time the pterodactyl was too close. It knocked the rifle from his hands and the bullet passed through its wing, too. The beast's eyes turned yellow, and it prepared to attack.

The pterodactyl spread its wings, preparing to fly away. Ignatius J. Reilly raised his eyes to the heavens, tears streaming down his cheeks. He would not let this be his destiny, not without a fight. He raised his fists, not caring if he died. The pterodactyl read his thoughts and attacked.
