Ignatius J. Reilly was walking down the street, clutching his precious copy of Boethius' The Consolation of Philosophy, when he heard a loud screech from above. He looked up and saw a huge winged creature swooping down on him. It had a long beak, sharp claws, and a reptilian body. It was a pterodactyl, one of the ancient flying dinosaurs that had somehow escaped extinction and found its way to New Orleans.

Ignatius gasped and dropped his book. He tried to run away, but the pterodactyl was faster. It grabbed him by his green hunting cap and lifted him off the ground. Ignatius felt a surge of terror and indignation. How dare this prehistoric beast interrupt his intellectual pursuits? He reached for his valve and tried to calm himself.

"Unhand me, you monstrous creature!" he shouted. "You are violating the laws of nature and civilization! You belong in a museum, not in the modern world!"

The pterodactyl ignored his protests and carried him higher into the air. It was hungry and had spotted Ignatius as a potential meal. It planned to drop him from a great height and then feast on his remains.

Ignatius realized that he had to act fast if he wanted to survive. He looked around and saw that they were flying over the Mississippi River. He had an idea. He grabbed the pterodactyl's neck and twisted it with all his strength. The pterodactyl let out a painful squawk and loosened its grip on Ignatius' cap. Ignatius freed himself and fell towards the water.

He plunged into the river with a splash. He felt a shock of coldness and wetness, but he was alive. He swam to the shore, coughing and sputtering. He looked up and saw that the pterodactyl was still circling above him, angry and confused. It had lost its prey and its dignity.

Ignatius climbed out of the water and picked up his book, which had landed nearby. He shook off the water and dusted off the pages. He felt a surge of triumph and satisfaction. He had defeated the pterodactyl with his superior intellect and courage.

He raised his book in the air and shouted: "Fortuna has smiled upon me today! I have vanquished my enemy and preserved my honor! I am Ignatius J. Reilly, the last defender of true culture and civilization!"

The pterodactyl screeched in frustration and flew away, looking for an easier target.
