Ignatius J. Reilly was strolling along the Audubon Park, munching on a hot dog and admiring the statues of Confederate heroes, when he heard a loud screech from above. He looked up and saw a huge winged creature swooping down on him, its beak open and its claws extended. It was a pterodactyl, a prehistoric monster that had somehow escaped from the museum of natural history.

Ignatius gasped and dropped his hot dog. He reached for his trusty hunting cap, which he always wore to protect his delicate ears from the noise of the modern world. He pulled it down over his eyes and hoped that the pterodactyl would mistake him for a statue or a bush.

But the pterodactyl was not fooled. It landed on the ground with a thud and snapped its jaws at Ignatius, who dodged nimbly to the side. Ignatius felt a surge of courage and indignation. How dare this beast attack him, a refined scholar and a defender of the true faith? He decided to fight back with his superior intellect and wit.

He shouted at the pterodactyl: "You foul creature! You are an abomination of nature, a relic of a barbaric age! You have no place in this civilized society, where men of letters and culture reign supreme! Begone, or I shall smite you with my mighty pen!"

The pterodactyl was not impressed by Ignatius's words. It screeched again and lunged at him, trying to bite his head off. Ignatius dodged again and ran towards a nearby bench. He grabbed a newspaper that someone had left behind and rolled it into a cone. He brandished it like a sword and charged at the pterodactyl.

"Take that, you fiend!" he cried, as he stabbed the newspaper cone into the pterodactyl's eye. The pterodactyl shrieked in pain and flapped its wings furiously, trying to shake off the paper weapon. Ignatius seized the opportunity and ran towards the park exit, hoping to find help.

But he was not fast enough. The pterodactyl recovered from its wound and flew after him, gaining speed. It caught up with Ignatius and grabbed him by his coat tails, lifting him off the ground. Ignatius screamed and kicked his legs in the air, clutching his hunting cap.

"Help! Help! Someone save me!" he yelled, as he soared over the park. "This is an outrage! This is an injustice! This is a violation of my human rights!"

But no one heard him or came to his rescue. The pterodactyl carried him away to its nest on top of a skyscraper, where it planned to feast on him later. Ignatius continued to protest and curse until he lost consciousness.

The end.
