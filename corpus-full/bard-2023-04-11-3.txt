Ignatius J. Reilly, the great tub of lard, lumbered down the street, his girth causing the sidewalk to buckle beneath his weight. He was on his way to the grocery store, where he would purchase a box of donuts and a gallon of ice cream. As he walked, he thought about all the things he hated about the world: the heat, the humidity, the people. He especially hated the pterodactyls.

Pterodactyls had been a problem in New Orleans for years. They were large, vicious creatures that preyed on the weak and helpless. Ignatius had seen them attack people on the street, and he had even heard stories of them carrying off children. He was determined to do something about it.

As he approached the grocery store, Ignatius saw a pterodactyl perched on the roof. It was a large, fearsome creature with sharp teeth and claws. Ignatius took a deep breath and charged at the pterodactyl.

The pterodactyl saw Ignatius coming and took flight. Ignatius chased after it, his great belly bouncing up and down. The pterodactyl led Ignatius on a chase through the city, swooping down on people and buildings. Ignatius was relentless, and he eventually cornered the pterodactyl on a rooftop.

The pterodactyl roared in anger and lunged at Ignatius. Ignatius ducked out of the way and swung his club, knocking the pterodactyl to the ground. The pterodactyl got back up and charged at Ignatius again. This time, Ignatius was ready for it. He swung his club with all his might, and the club connected with the pterodactyl's skull. The pterodactyl let out a cry of pain and fell to the ground, dead.

Ignatius stood over the dead pterodactyl, his club raised in triumph. He had done it. He had defeated the pterodactyl. The people of New Orleans were safe, thanks to him.

Ignatius turned and walked away, his head held high. He was a hero.
