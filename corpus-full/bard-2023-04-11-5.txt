Ignatius J. Reilly, the great sloth of modern literature, was not a man of action. He was a man of inaction, a man of inertia, a man of sloth. He was a man who would rather sit in his mother's basement and eat bologna sandwiches than do anything else in the world.

But one day, Ignatius was forced into action. He was forced to fight for his life.

It all started when Ignatius was walking home from the grocery store. He was carrying a heavy bag of groceries, and he was sweating profusely. He was also very hungry, and he was looking forward to eating his bologna sandwiches.

As he was walking, Ignatius saw a pterodactyl. It was a large, feathered creature with sharp claws and teeth. It was the first time Ignatius had ever seen a pterodactyl, and he was understandably terrified.

The pterodactyl saw Ignatius, and it swooped down upon him. Ignatius dropped his groceries and ran for his life. But the pterodactyl was faster. It caught up to Ignatius and grabbed him with its sharp claws.

Ignatius struggled to free himself, but the pterodactyl was too strong. The pterodactyl lifted Ignatius into the air and carried him away.

Ignatius was terrified. He thought he was going to die. But then, he had an idea.

He reached into his pocket and pulled out a bologna sandwich. He threw the sandwich at the pterodactyl. The sandwich hit the pterodactyl in the eye, and the pterodactyl roared in pain.

The pterodactyl dropped Ignatius, and Ignatius fell to the ground. He was safe, but he was also very hungry.

Ignatius picked up his groceries and walked home. He was still shaken by his experience, but he was also grateful to be alive.

As he walked, Ignatius thought about what had happened. He realized that he had been forced to fight for his life, and he had won. He had defeated the pterodactyl, and he had survived.

Ignatius realized that he was stronger than he thought he was. He realized that he was capable of more than he had ever imagined.

Ignatius J. Reilly was a changed man. He was no longer the slothful man he had once been. He was now a man of action, a man of courage, a man of strength.

He was a man who had defeated a pterodactyl.
