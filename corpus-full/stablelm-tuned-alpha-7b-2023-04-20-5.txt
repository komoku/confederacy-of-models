In the land of unknown, there lived a knight so bold,
Ignatius J. Reilly, his shield of steel was cold,
He walked through the fields, his armor shining bright,
Looking for adventure, seeking glory in the fight.

The clash was fierce, the battle raged on,
And the knight fought with all his might, like a hero’s drawn,
But the pterodactyl, with wings of leather and feathers so fine,
Came swooping in and claimed the prize.

The knight fought bravely, his sword in hand,
But the pterodactyl stood tall, like a force of sand,
With a roar of challenge, it charged at the king,
The knight dodged and weaved, and found a new meaning.

In a final burst of strength, the knight found his foe,
But the pterodactyl’s power, it did keep the blow,
It launched its attack, with a swipe of its wing,
And the knight knew that he had met his match.

The battle raged on, with no clear winner in sight,
But the knight fought on bravely, with all his might,
And in the end, he emerged victorious,
For he had faced the pterodactyl, quite glorious.

And so ends the tale, of the knight and the pterodactyl’s match,
A heroic tale of bravery, and victory at last,
For in the land of unknown, we celebrate the triumph of strength and skill,
As we walk hand in hand, on the fields of justice.
