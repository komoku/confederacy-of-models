Here is my attempt at an epic narration of single combat between Ignatius J. Reilly and a pterodactyl in the style of John Kennedy Toole:

The sun beat down mercilessly on the dusty hills of prehistoric New Orleans, illuminating the wings of a lone pterodactyl circling overhead. Below, Ignatius J. Reilly trudged up the path to the crest of the hill, mopping the sweat from his plump and pockmarked face with a grubby handkerchief. His ponderous bulk strained the seams of his hunting pants and safari jacket as he panted from the exertion.

At the top of the hill, Ignatius paused to catch his breath andsurvey the valley below. But his repose was shattered by an ear-splitting shriek as the pterodactyl swooped down upon him, gnashing its jagged beak. Ignatius stumbled back in terror and swung his butterfly net wildly, entangling it around the pterodactyl's leathery wings. The creature crashed to the ground, squealing and thrashing about in a cloud of dust.

Seeing his chance, Ignatius lunged at the downed beast, bringing his considerable weight to bear. But with a roar, the pterodactyl flexed its powerful wings and flung Ignatius off, sending him tumbling arse over teakettle down the hillside. Bruised and battered, his trousers in tatters, Ignatius scrambled back up the hill just as the pterodactyl took flight again, circling back for another attack.

Summoning what little courage he possessed, Ignatius brandished his butterfly net like a gladiator's trident. "En garde, you Mesozoic miscreant!" he cried. The pterodactyl swooped once more, but Ignatius deftly sidestepped and swung with all his might, clobbering the creature on its scrawny neck. The pterodactyl shrieked as it crashed to the ground in a flurry of wings, defeated at last.

Ignatius stood panting over his vanquished foe, butterly net held aloft in triumph. The era of the pterosaurs had ended; the age of Reilly had begun.
