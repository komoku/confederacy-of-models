Here is my attempt at an epic narration of a single combat between Ignatius J. Reilly and a pterodactyl in the style of John Kennedy Toole:

The hot sun beat down upon the prehistoric jungle canopy as Ignatius J. Reilly trudged through the underbrush, his flabby flesh quivering with each labored step. His voluminous tweed trousers were soaked through with sweat, and his asthmatic wheezing echoed through the foliage.

Suddenly, a primeval shriek rent the air as an enormous pterodactyl burst through the treetops, its leathery wings flapping furiously. The pterodactyl spied the portly Ignatius below and descended rapidly, cruel beak agape, eager to make a meal of this strange pink creature that had wandered into its domain.

Ignatius turned and gazed upwards at the approaching reptile, letting out a terrified groan. His pudgy fingers grasped for the stick of little waxen wings protruding from the brim of his disintegrating hunting cap, and with a mighty rip, tore them free. Waving the wings aloft, Ignatius let out a war cry to rally whatever remnants of courage still remained in his ample frame.

The pterodactyl shrieked in response and dove at Ignatius, massive claws extended. But Ignatius swung his waxen wings with all his might, smacking the surprised pterodactyl directly in the eye. The pterodactyl squawked in anger and pain, veering away and nearly crashing into a tree.

Ignatius swung again, pummeling the pterodactyl about the head and neck, driving it back with each meaty blow. His asthma and corpulence forgotten, Ignatius let loose a torrent of epithets at his foe, condemning its ancestory and questioning its virtue with orotund phrases. The pterodactyl, its miniature brain rattled under this verbal and physical assault, eventually gave up and flapped off in confusion, leaving Ignatius triumphant in the jungle clearing. His trusty waxen wings had saved him, and would live on forever as a reminder of his victory over the saurian menace.
