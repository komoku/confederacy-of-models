Here is my attempt at an epic narration of Ignatius J. Reilly battling a pterodactyl in the style of John Kennedy Toole:

The slothful behemoth Ignatius J. Reilly trudged through the primordial jungle, wheezing mightily with each elephantine step. His voluminous tweed trousers were stained with the grime of the swamp and hazardously close to slipping from his waist. As Ignatius suffered the torments of the damned whilst walking - his massive bulk bringing him pain with every movement - his mind was awhirl with esoteric thoughts of Boethius and sacred geometry.

Suddenly, a deafening shriek rent the prehistoric air and a shadow swept over Ignatius. He glanced skyward and beheld a terrifying vision from his worst fever dreams: an enormous pterodactyl, leathery wings spread and sharp beak agape, dove swiftly toward him with obvious malicious intent.

"Oh my God!" Ignatius bellowed, frantically waving the tattered remains of his scarf in a futile attempt to ward off the prehistoric beast. His mother would never believe this assault on his personage, he fretted. The pterodactyl let out another shriek, closer now, and Ignatius could see its beady eyes filled with primeval bloodlust.

Summoning what little vigor remained in his rotund frame, Ignatius grabbed a large branch and swung with all his might as the pterodactyl descended upon him, talons extended. By some miracle, the branch connected with the creature's knobby skull, and it squawked in startled pain, veering away and nearly crashing into the jungle canopy.

Ignatius watched in exhausted triumph as the pterodactyl flapped off into the primeval sky, nursing its bruised head. "Begone, you meat-faced devil!" Ignatius wheezed after it. His valves thoroughly overloaded by the unwonted excitement, Ignatius collapsed onto a mossy rock and fanned himself with his scarf, rejoicing that Fortuna had smiled upon him on this precarious day. The epic battle had been won, but at what cost to his fragile system? Only time would tell.
