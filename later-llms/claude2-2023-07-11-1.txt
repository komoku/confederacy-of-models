Here is my attempt at an epic narration of a single combat between Ignatius J. Reilly and a pterodactyl in the style of John Kennedy Toole:

The heavy jowl of Ignatius J. Reilly quivered in anticipation of the battle to come. His fleshy lips pursed in grim determination as his blue and yellow eyes peered myopically at the leathery beast circling above the crumbling Colosseum. The pterodactyl let out a piercing shriek, rattling the very stones of the ancient amphitheater and sending a chill down the expansive spine of the quixotic crusader.

Ignatius steeled himself, clutching his weapon—a tattered copy of Boethius’ Consolation of Philosophy—in his hot little hands. His voluminous tweed trousers swished as he waddled into the center of the arena, wheezing from the exertion but fortified by the caffeine and sugar swirling in his veins.

The pterodactyl swooped down, gnarled claws extended, ragged wings beating a tempest. Its jagged beak parted to reveal a gaping maw with rows of vicious teeth. The crowd gasped. But Ignatius stood firm, whipping out his weapon and hurling philosophic maxims at the beast like stones. “Now is no time for half measures!” he thundered, quoting his beloved Boethius.

Enraged, the pterodactyl let out an ear-piercing cry and lunged at Ignatius. He deftly dodged, the pterodactyl just missing the fluttering scarf around his neck, and brought his book crashing down on the creature’s skull. It tumbled to the ground, stunned. The crowd erupted.

Ignatius waddled over to the creature and gazed into its jaundiced eye. “You have been felled by philosophy itself, you poor primitive brute,” he sniffed. The pterodactyl squawked weakly in protest, flapping its broken wings.

The Goliath had been vanquished by an intellectual David. Ignatius J. Reilly emerged victorious once more thanks to fortune and philosophy. His epic battle now concluded, he waddled out of the arena in search of a hot dog vendor, his scarf billowing behind him like a triumphant cape.
