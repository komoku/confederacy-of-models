Here is my attempt at an epic narration of single combat between Ignatius J. Reilly and a pterodactyl in the style of John Kennedy Toole:

The twin suns of Valuable Discount Chemicals blistered the pavement as Ignatius J. Reilly shuffled down Constantine Street, masticating the last fragments of a Zagnut bar left over from his lunch consumed so many hours ago in his bedroom fortress. His capacious flannel trousers festooned with crumbs and melted chocolate, Ignatius felt the familiar rumblings of discontent arising from his stomach's nether regions.

But his flailing arms could not match the mighty wings of his prehistoric opponent.
