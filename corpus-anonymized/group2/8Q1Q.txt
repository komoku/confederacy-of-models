The prehistoric beast let out a piercing shriek as it descended from the gray sky, its leathery wings beating furiously. Ignatius peered up from under his hunting cap, clutching his Big Chief tablets and yellow pencils.

"Ah, a pterodactyl," Ignatius sighed in annoyance, as if encountering an irksome fly. "I don't suppose you could find a more remote era to inhabit? Kindly remove your unpleasantly scaly presence from my contemporary world."

The pterodactyl dove at Ignatius, snapping its jagged beak. But with surprising dexterity, Ignatius grabbed his valve and hurled it at the pterodactyl's head, causing the beast to veer off in a disoriented flutter of wings.

"Now look what you've made me do, you absurd creature," Ignatius groaned as the valve clattered to the ground, its strap dangling limply.

Enraged, the pterodactyl circled back around and swooped at Ignatius again. This time he seized his martyr medal of St. Sara and swung it with all his might, clocking the pterodactyl in one eye and sending a spray of blood and feathers as the bird crashed to the ground.

Panting from the exertion, Ignatius trudged over to the beast, which was shrieking in terror and attempting to flap its mangled wings. "There, there," Ignatius said, placing a pudgy hand on its scaly head. "Be comforted that you met your fate at the hands of something far more formidable than a mere asteroid."

With that, Ignatius J. Reilly waddled off into the sunset, vanquisher of ancient evils, as the pterodactyl retreated through a time portal with a bruised eye and newfound respect for the formidable beasts of the 20th century.
