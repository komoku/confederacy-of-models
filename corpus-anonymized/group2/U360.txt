In the swampy wastes outside New Orleans lived a man of great renown, Ignatius Jacques Reilly - scholar, warrior and devotee of hot buttered cinnamon toast. For years he had battled against the sinister forces that sought to destroy his city's way of life; Confederacy of Dunces at rest were not his strong suit.

But one fateful day, as he strolled through the mist-choked forests around Audubon Park, a monstrous creature descended upon him from the sky: a massive Pterodactyl with scales like obsidian, eyes shining red like embers, talons that could rend steel in twain...and perhaps most terrifyingly of all? Noxious flatulence resembling the acrid stench from the murky brackish waters after a weeklong rainfall.  A hideous beast. It was clear that only one of these titans would walk away, unscathed.

Ignatius did not back down before such a fierce foe. With his trusty copy of The Proust Questionnaire clutched firmly in hand (its pages dog-eared from extensive use), the portly sage charged forward, determined to slay the dragon once and for all. His adversary lunged forth, beak snapping shut mere centimeters from his face...but he met this strike by jamming a thumb into each eye socket, blindfolding it temporarily. Time seemed to slow to molasses-like crawl when the next move arrived.
The dino launched itself upwards to gain height in order to launch itself at him again, giving him a few moments respite to gather himself. There was no time to waste! He needed leverage greater than simply muscle. Cunning must come first here. Ignatius swiftly retrieved his compact makeup mirror tucked within his bookbag and held aloft. This sparkling metal surface proved too much for this feathered menace. Enraptured entirely by its own reflection, it became fixated on its image, wholly unaware of his approach. Without hesitation the burly human flung himself bodily onto its scaly neck and tightened both arms firmly under the jawline till he heard audible popping indicating its spinal column snapped in two. Its body fell limp, and soon thereafter so too did our exhausted protagonist from sheer exertion.  Breath wheezing in an out , he muttered something about needing a nap, some orange juice and maybe even attempting to track down this Mirror, My Enemy novel written by a fellow named Dashiell Hammett he had been interested in reading.
