The prehistoric beast let out a bone-chilling shriek as it descended from the smog-choked sky, its leathery wings casting a shadow over the rooftops of New Orleans.

Ignatius J. Reilly peered up from under his green hunting cap and gasped. He fumbled for the hot dog in his pocket and took a mighty bite, using the surge of energy to heft his medieval sword and shield. This would not be an ordinary encounter at the hot dog stand.

The pterodactyl landed before Ignatius with a thud, folding its wings and fixing him with a glare from its reptilian eyes. It snapped its beak menacingly, hungry for its first meal in 66 million years.

Ignatius took a practiced swing with his sword, but the pterodactyl lunged aside with alarming speed. “Stand still, you recalcitrant beast!” Ignatius wheezed. The pterodactyl shrieked again and flapped at him with a gnarled claw.

His shield arm trembling, Ignatius dove forward in a burst of valor and landed a blow on the pterodactyl’s scaly thigh. The monster canted its head and regarded him quizzically, as if unsure how this round creature had proven such a troublesome foe.

Steadfast in his courage yet panting from the exertion, Ignatius brandished his sword and trotted toward the pterodactyl in a menacing goose-step. The beast’s nerve broke at last. With a flap of its tattered wings, it took to the sky—but not before Ignatius lunged in a final mighty swipe of his sword, leaving a gash on the pterodactyl’s flank as a parting gift.

Ignatius watched it flee into the horizon, a sneer of victory contorting his fleshy face. He sat heavily on the sidewalk, clutching his chest and wheezing. The hot dog cart was his domain once more. The prehistoric menace had met its match in Ignatius J. Reilly, crusader of the modern age.
