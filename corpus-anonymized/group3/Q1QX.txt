It was early in the morning, on a fine spring day in the year 2061, and Ignatius J. Reilly was working on his car in his small, run-down apartment, located on the twelfth floor of a run-down high-rise building in downtown New York City. Ignatius was a well-known, but poor historian, who wrote books about the history of the Roman Catholic Church, and other obscure topics.

As Ignatius sat, writing in his author's desk, he could hear the sounds of the city below him - the traffic, the sirens, and the bells of the church. Ignatius was a deep thinker, and often wrote his thoughts down, in the form of essays, which he would later sell to a small publisher, who put them into books.

Ignatius' apartment was a mess, as he lived alone, and did not have any servants, as he could not afford to pay them. The walls were bare, and the furniture was cheap, second-hand pieces that Ignatius had purchased from a nearby thrift store.

Suddenly, there was a loud THUMP from outside, and Ignatius looked up, startled, from his writing desk. He saw, with horror, that a large pterodactyl was perched outside his window, outside on the ledge, preening and flapping its huge, bat-like wings.

The pterodactyl, which had apparently mistaken Ignatius' apartment for a nesting ground, let out a blood-curdling cry, and let loose a stream of fire from its mouth, which landed inside the room, and singed a large hole in the roof. Ignatius leapt to his feet, in a state of shock, and backed slowly away from the window, staring in horror at the fiery scene outside.

The pterodactyl, seeing Ignatius, let out a blood-curdling cry of its own, and launched itself at the window, striking out with its huge, scaled wings. Ignatius, in a panic, scrambled to get away, but tripped over a small table, and fell to the floor, amidst a cacophony of flapping and screeching.

The pterodactyl, having mistaken Ignatius for a small mammal, had apparently decided to eat him for breakfast. It let out another cry of rage, and flapped its huge wings, attempting to smash open the window, so that it could get at Ignatius.

Ignatius, on the floor, frantically crawled away from the window, thinking quickly on his feet. He reached into his desk, and pulled out a revolver, which he had purchased from a gun store down the street. Ignatius pointed the gun at the window, and fired a single shot, which hit the pterodactyl right in its shiny, black-scaled head.

The pterodactyl, stunned by the gunshot, beat its wings furiously, but could not gain enough momentum to break through the window. It let out a blood-curdling cry of rage, and flapped its wings even more furiously, before finally crashing to the ground, and exploding into a ball of flame.

Ignatius, who had been hiding behind a large painting, ran to the door, and locked it, before calling the police. Once the police had arrived, and examined the scene, they were able to determine that the pterodactyl had mistaken Ignatius' apartment for a nesting ground, after hearing the sounds of the city - the traffic, sirens, bells, and shouts of the church - leaking into the building.

Ignatius, in the end, was not charged for the shooting, as the police had not found any evidence of a gun in the pterodactyl's possession. Ignatius, however, was required to pay for the damages to the building, and for the replacement of the roof.
