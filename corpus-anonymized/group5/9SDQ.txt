Ignatius J. Reilly was walking down the street, clutching his precious copy of Boethius' Consolation of Philosophy to his chest, when he heard a loud screech from above. He looked up and saw a huge winged creature swooping down on him, its beak open and its claws extended. It was a pterodactyl, a prehistoric monster that had somehow escaped from the museum and was now terrorizing the city.

Ignatius felt a surge of panic and indignation. How dare this beast interrupt his meditations on the wheel of fortune? He quickly ducked into a nearby alley, hoping to evade the attack. But the pterodactyl was faster and followed him, landing on the roof of a building and blocking his exit.

Ignatius realized he had no choice but to face the creature. He took off his green hunting cap and waved it in the air, trying to scare it away. "Go back to your fossilized bones, you abominable relic!" he shouted. "You have no place in this modern world of progress and enlightenment!"

The pterodactyl was not impressed by Ignatius' words. It let out another screech and leaped from the roof, aiming for Ignatius' head. Ignatius dodged the attack and swung his cap at the pterodactyl's face, hitting it in the eye. The pterodactyl recoiled and flapped its wings, creating a gust of wind that knocked Ignatius off balance.

Ignatius stumbled and fell to the ground, dropping his book. The pterodactyl seized the opportunity and grabbed the book in its beak, lifting it into the air. Ignatius gasped in horror. He could not lose his precious Boethius! He got up and ran after the pterodactyl, shouting curses and insults.

"Give me back my book, you winged demon!" he yelled. "You have no idea what you are holding! It is a masterpiece of philosophy, a guide to happiness and virtue! You are unworthy of touching it!"

The pterodactyl ignored Ignatius' pleas and flew higher and higher, until it reached the top of a skyscraper. It landed on the edge of the roof and looked down at Ignatius, who was panting and sweating on the street below. The pterodactyl seemed to smirk as it opened its beak and prepared to drop the book.

Ignatius felt a surge of rage and despair. He could not let this happen. He had to save his book. He had to save himself. He gathered all his strength and courage and shouted at the top of his lungs:

"Fortuna! Fortuna! Spin your wheel! Give me back my Boethius!"

As if by magic, a gust of wind blew at that moment, catching the book as it fell from the pterodactyl's beak. The book flew back towards Ignatius, who reached out his arms and caught it in mid-air. He hugged it to his chest and smiled triumphantly.

The pterodactyl was stunned by this turn of events. It could not believe that Ignatius had managed to reclaim his book. It felt a pang of fear and regret. It realized it had made a mistake by messing with Ignatius J. Reilly.

It decided to leave him alone and fly away, looking for an easier prey.

Ignatius watched as the pterodactyl disappeared into the sky. He felt a wave of relief and gratitude wash over him. He had won. He had defeated the pterodactyl. He had preserved his Boethius.

He put on his cap and adjusted his valve. He looked around and saw that no one had witnessed his heroic deed. He shrugged and walked away, humming a tune.

He thought to himself:

"Fortune favors the brave."
