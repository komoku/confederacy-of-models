Ignatius J. Reilly, the great sloth of the modern world, was walking home from the grocery store when he saw a pterodactyl. The pterodactyl was huge, with a wingspan of at least twenty feet. It was perched on a rooftop, staring down at Ignatius with its beady eyes.

Ignatius was terrified. He had never seen a pterodactyl before, and he didn't know what to do. He thought about running away, but he knew that the pterodactyl would catch him. He thought about calling for help, but he knew that no one would believe him.

So Ignatius did the only thing he could think of. He stood his ground and faced the pterodactyl.

The pterodactyl screeched and flapped its wings. Ignatius held his ground.

The pterodactyl swooped down, its beak open wide. Ignatius ducked just in time.

The pterodactyl flew back up and tried again. Ignatius dodged this time, too.

The pterodactyl continued to attack, but Ignatius was always one step ahead. He was too slow and too fat to be a good fighter, but he was clever. He used his surroundings to his advantage, ducking behind cars and hiding in alleyways.

The pterodactyl was getting tired. Its wings were flapping slower and its screeches were getting weaker.

Finally, the pterodactyl gave up. It flew away, disappearing into the sky.

Ignatius was exhausted, but he was also triumphant. He had defeated the pterodactyl! He was a hero!

Ignatius walked home, his head held high. He was a changed man. He was no longer the slothful, lazy person he had been before. He was now a warrior, a conqueror. He had faced his fears and emerged victorious.

Ignatius J. Reilly was a hero.
