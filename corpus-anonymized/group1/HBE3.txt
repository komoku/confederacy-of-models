The primordial beast descended from the sky with a reptilian screech, its leathery wings casting a shadow over the suburban rooftops. Ignatius J. Reilly stood in the alleyway behind Paradise Vendors and gazed up at the pterodactyl, clutching his hot dog tightly.

"Ah, another demented acquaintance from the Jurassic has come calling," Ignatius snorted. He took a large bite of hot dog, the grease dribbling down his multiple chins.

The pterodactyl swooped toward the rotund crusader, snapping its beak hungrily. But Ignatius stood as an immovable object, his bulk stubbornly anchored to the asphalt.

"Your pitiful squawks do not frighten me, you feathered fowl," Ignatius bellowed. He hurled the remaining hot dog at the pterodactyl. It bounced harmlessly off the creature's scaly chest.

Enraged, the pterodactyl plunged toward Ignatius, talons extended. But Ignatius grasped the beast in his meaty hands and, summoning unexpected strength, wrestled the creature skyward. The pterodactyl shrieked in dismay as Ignatius climbed atop its back, his weight bending its primitive spine.

"Onward, my scaly steed!" Ignatius cried, grabbing the creature's beak and steering it up toward the clouds. The pterodactyl flapped madly, straining under Ignatius's bulk.

New Orleans gaped as the bizarre sight passed overheadâ€”the valiant crusader astride his subjugated foe, soaring off into prehistory. Ignatius J. Reilly had once again vanquished a threat to civilization and secured his place in myth and legend. The end.
